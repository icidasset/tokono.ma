I uploaded my bought music to Amazon S3 and connected it to my app. Since then it\'s evolved into a decentralised local-first app. It\'s got two layers of data storage, (1) the user-data layer with your favourites, playlists, etc, and (2) the music layer. Both layers can have separate remote storages, for example, user data on Dropbox and music on Amazon S3."
